    <h2>A little about me...</h2>
    <p>As a senior at the University of Washington, I've had the opportunity to study Computer Science, learning, interning in, advising on, and living what I love everyday. My time in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering has afforded me amazing experiences studying a variety of topics in computing and technology. The UW's Honors Program has rounded out this experience with rich interdisciplinary studies. My time in the Greek Community has taught me more about leadership and friendship than I could have imagined. </p>
