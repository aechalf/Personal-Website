							<h1>Amanda Chalfant:<br/><i>UW Story</i></h1>
							<p class="major">Reflecting on my experiences during my time at UW, I have found an immense shift in the way that I think of myself and my relationships, to people and to the world. I started my journey at UW hoping to find my community, whatever that meant; whether this would be found through Computer Science, my new sorority, or  Honors, I was not sure yet. <b>Yet as I look back, I've found that my time here was shaped more by my growing independence and individuality rather than my allegiance to different groups.</b> I’m a unique combination of all of these communities – software engineer, sorority woman, honors student, and more. I’ve found more ways to stand out rather than fit in, as well as slowly give back to these communities I’ve formed.</p>

							<p>Toward the beginning of my second year, I started to feel like I really had the whole college thing down (<i>I admire my former self’s confidence</i>). I was among the selective cohort of new CSE students, and I began to see how I could involve myself more in the communities that were important to me. I was appointed to the position of <b>Scholarship Chair</b> in my sorority, a role I had wanted since I’d heard of its existence. My job entailed keeping track of the academics of our chapter’s 125 women: working with those whose grades were under our minimum standard, rewarding sisters who’d achieved personal successes, and developing scholastic programs to benefit the entire chapter. At times, it felt somewhat awkward to be privy to the academic challenges of all of my friends, and I constantly worked on how to maintain professionalism in my role while still having compassion and friendships. <b>During my time as chair, our chapter was second in grades out of eighteen Panhellenic chapters for two consecutive quarters, and I attended our chapter’s regional leadership conference where we were honored.</b></p>

							<p>During my junior year, I was awarded the opportunity to travel to Texas for the <b>Grace Hopper Celebration</b> through the Allen School. GHC is an incredible conference for women in technology; I attended talks, including a keynote by US CTO Megan Smith, met other women from around the country, and interviewed with companies for coveted internships. <b>I was absolutely amazed at the sheer power of the women at the event, and how friendly, curious, and inspirational each individual was.</b> I also deepened my connections to other UW women in CSE, helping to bring some of this empowering movement back to Seattle. I earned sought-after internship offers from both <b>Apple and Google</b> while at GHC, helping to further my career and my enthusiasm for technology.</p>

							<p>This high was somewhat dulled as I got back to school and was swamped with Honors and CS coursework. But what was largely more difficult was dealing with my newfound mental health problems. Stemming from particularly traumatic events my freshman year, I started developing <b>intense flashbacks and avoidance symptoms</b>, causing me social anxiety. I would go to class, fulfill my obligations academically and socially, and then retreat back to my room, feeling as though my very existence wasn’t worth anything. All the while, I was taking some of my toughest classes to date, applying to rigorous internships at top companies, and continuing my membership to my sorority. After I took off winter quarter for my internship, further leading to my isolation, I came back to UW and was diagnosed with <b>post-traumatic stress disorder</b>. This actually helped me to understand and put a label to what I was feeling, and a plan to heal. I realized that instead of drawing away from my friendships, I would have to go out of my comfort zone and ask for help from those closest to me. This wasn’t easy, as I pride myself on being someone who is capable of handling most things independently, but ultimately by reaching out, I was able to get the help and support from my community that I so desperately needed. <b>From this experience, I learned that even the most accomplished people like myself can experience mental health problems, it is not my fault, and that I could—and would—beat the pain.</b></p>

						<p>Following the difficult past year, I have a <b>newfound confidence and balance in my life</b>. My PTSD is on the path to healing through regular yoga, self-care, and therapy, and I have learned a lot from these struggles. Starting this year, I wanted to be able to help others in their own unique experiences; this led me to be chosen among many applicants to be a <b>Peer Adviser for the Allen School</b>. I am able to draw on past lessons from internships, coursework, and personal life to aid other students in their journey through UW and CSE. Working with a diverse range of students each day is challenging; I have spoken with students in crisis that they will never be admitted to a major, feeling like failures to their family. <b>In situations like those, I’ve learned to use empathy, helping someone realize that they are more than just a grade, major, or degree.</b> My work has been extremely rewarding, giving me a new appreciation for the work that goes into a program like the Allen School. I’ve been able to leave my mark on my school, giving back to a place that helped me grow.</p>

						<p class="major">Well, that is my story so far. In June, I will graduate and several months later begin my dream job as a <b>Software Engineer at Microsoft in the Azure Cloud Computing group</b>. This decision was not easy to make—it was between prestigious offers between Apple and Microsoft, <i>go figure</i>—yet I am sure-footed with the knowledge that all of my experiences, from the extreme highs to the extreme lows, have contributed to the person that I am today. <b>A fit in, stand out, give back sort of person.</b></p>
